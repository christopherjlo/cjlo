        <p class="food">I like all types of food and am not picky, but I like rice dishes
            the most. I could eat fried rice every day! My favorite noodle
            dish is probably ramen. I usually get tonkotsu (pork broth) ramen,
            and lately I've started to like putting more chilis in them to make
            it spicier. My spice tolerance isn't great, but I'm trying to get
            better at eating spicy food.
